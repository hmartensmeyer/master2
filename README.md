# master2

Second attempt on this repo!

This repository contains the scripts and functions used for the master's project: "Detecting surface features in a water channel from ceiling reflections, and their sub-surface counterparts". As of march 2025 this is still highly under development. A more thorough manual will be made if the author has any life left in him by the end of the semester.
